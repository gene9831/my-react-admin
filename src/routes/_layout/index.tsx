        Paras is an orange, insectoid Pok√©mon that resembles the nymph stage of
        a cicada. Its ovoid body is segmented, and it has three pairs of legs.

        tips. There are five specks on its forehead and three teeth on either
        side of its mouth. It has circular eyes with large pseudopupils.
